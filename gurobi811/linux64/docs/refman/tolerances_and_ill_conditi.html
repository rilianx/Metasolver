Tolerances and Ill Conditioning - A Caveat
</H2>

<P>
As noted at several places in this section, finite-precision
arithmetic limits the precision of the solutions Gurobi computes.
This limitation is managed through numerical tolerances in most cases;
we treat a solution as satisfying a constraint if the violation is
smaller than the corresponding tolerance.  The default tolerances are
chosen to be sufficiently large so that numerical errors aren't an
issue for most models.

<P>
Unfortunately, some models suffer from severe <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ill conditioning</SPAN>,
which can greatly complicate the search for a solution.  This can show
itself in a few ways.  Ill conditioning can severely hurt performance,
and it can lead to solutions whose constraint violations are larger
than the tolerances.

<P>
Ill conditioning is a measure of the amount of error that can result
when solving linear systems of equations.  As noted earlier, linear
and mixed-integer programming are built on top of linear solves, so
errors in solving linear systems directly lead to errors in LP and MIP
solutions.  Serious problems arise when the error in solving a linear
system is comparable to the desired tolerance.  If you want to solve a
linear programming problem to the default feasibility tolerance of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img109.png"
 ALT="$1e-6$"></SPAN>, for example, and if your linear system solves produce errors
that are also roughly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img109.png"
 ALT="$1e-6$"></SPAN>, then you have no way of knowing whether
your current solution is truly feasible.  This can lead to
oscillations, as your solution bounces between feasible and infeasible
due to nothing more than numerical error, which can make it extremely
difficult to achieve forward progress towards an optimal solution.

<P>
When solving linear and quadratic programming problems, we recommend
that you check final primal and dual constraint violations.  Duality
theory states that, if your solution is primal feasible, dual
feasible, and complementary, then you have an optimal solution.
Complementarity is automatically enforced by the simplex method, so
achieving primal and dual feasibility (to tolerances) assures that the
solution is optimal (to tolerances).

<P>
When solving a MIP model, there is unfortunately no simple method
available to check the optimality of the result.  While we work hard
to identify and manage the negative effects of ill conditioning, we
are unable to provide a mathematical proof that the solution returned
is truly optimal.
