Python API Overview
</H1>

<P>
This section documents the Gurobi Python interface.  It begins with an
overview of the global functions, which can be called without
referencing any Python objects.  It then discusses the different types
of objects that are available in the interface, and the most important
methods on those objects.  Finally, it gives a
<A HREF="py_python_api_details.html#sec:Python-details">comprehensive
presentation of all of the available classes and methods</A>.

<P>
If you are new to the Gurobi Optimizer, we suggest that you start with
the
<A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="../quickstart_windows/index.html">Quick Start Guide</A>
or the
<A NAME="tex2html20"
  HREF="../examples/examples.html">Example Tour</A>.
These documents provide concrete examples of how to use the classes
and methods described here.

<P>
<B>Important note for AIX users:</B> due to limited Python support on
AIX, our AIX port does not include the Python interface.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Global Functions</SPAN>

<P>
The Gurobi shell contains a set of <A HREF="py_global_functions.html#pythonclass:Global">Global
  Functions</A> that can be called without
referring to any Gurobi objects.  The most important of these
functions is probably the <A HREF="py_read.html#pythonmethod:read">read</A>
function, which allows you to read a model from a file.  Other useful
global functions are <A HREF="py_system.html#pythonmethod:system">system</A>, which
allows you to issue shell commands from within the Gurobi shell,
<A HREF="py_models.html#pythonmethod:models">models</A>, which gives you a list of
the currently loaded models, and
<A HREF="py_disposedefaultenv.html#pythonmethod:disposeDefaultEnv">disposeDefaultEnv</A>,
which disposes of the default environment.  Other global functions
allow you to read, modify, or write Gurobi parameters
(<A HREF="py_readparams.html#pythonmethod:readParams">readParams</A>,
<A HREF="py_setparam.html#pythonmethod:setParam">setParam</A>, and
<A HREF="py_writeparams.html#pythonmethod:writeParams">writeParams</A>).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Models</SPAN>

<P>
Most actions in the Gurobi Python interface are performed by calling
methods on Gurobi objects.  The most commonly used object is
the <A HREF="py_model.html#pythonclass:Model">Model</A>.  A model consists of a
set of decision variables (objects of class
<A HREF="py_var.html#pythonclass:Var">Var</A>), a linear or quadratic
objective function on these variables (specified using
<A HREF="py_model_setobjective.html#pythonmethod:Model.setObjective">Model.setObjective</A>),
and a set of constraints on these variables (objects of class
<A HREF="py_constr.html#pythonclass:Constr">Constr</A>,
<A HREF="py_qconstr.html#pythonclass:QConstr">QConstr</A>,
<A HREF="py_sos.html#pythonclass:SOS">SOS</A>,
or <A HREF="py_genconstr.html#pythonclass:GenConstr">GenConstr</A>).
Each variable has an
associated lower bound, upper bound, and type
(continuous, binary, etc.).  Each linear or
quadratic constraint has an associated
sense (less-than-or-equal, greater-than-or-equal, or equal), and
right-hand side value.  Refer to
<A HREF="variables_and_constraints.html#sec:VarsAndConstraints">this section</A>
for more information on variables and constraints.

<P>
Linear objectives can also be defined when a variable is being added to the
model (see&nbsp;<A HREF="py_model_addvar.html#pythonmethod:Model.addVar">Model.addVar</A>),
however
<A HREF="py_model_setobjective.html#pythonmethod:Model.setObjective">Model.setObjective</A> is
often preferable because it is easier to read and maintain.

<P>
An optimization model may be specified all at once, by loading the
model from a file (using the previously mentioned
<A HREF="py_read.html#pythonmethod:read">read</A> function), or it may be built
incrementally, by first constructing an empty object of class
<A HREF="py_model.html#pythonclass:Model">Model</A> and then subsequently
calling
<A HREF="py_model_addvar.html#pythonmethod:Model.addVar">Model.addVar</A> or
<A HREF="py_model_addvars.html#pythonmethod:Model.addVars">Model.addVars</A> to add
additional variables,
and
<A HREF="py_model_addconstr.html#pythonmethod:Model.addConstr">Model.addConstr</A>,
<A HREF="py_model_addconstrs.html#pythonmethod:Model.addConstrs">Model.addConstrs</A>,
<A HREF="py_model_addlconstr.html#pythonmethod:Model.addLConstr">Model.addLConstr</A>,
<A HREF="py_model_addqconstr.html#pythonmethod:Model.addQConstr">Model.addQConstr</A>,
<A HREF="py_model_addsos.html#pythonmethod:Model.addSOS">Model.addSOS</A>, or any of the
<A HREF="py_model_addgenconstrxxx.html#pythonmethod:Model.addGenConstrXxx">Model.addGenConstrXxx</A> methods
to add additional constraints.

<P>
Linear constraints are specified by building linear expressions
(objects of class <A HREF="py_linexpr.html#pythonclass:LinExpr">LinExpr</A>), and
then specifying relationships between these expressions (for example,
requiring that one expression be equal to another).  Quadratic
constraints are built in a similar fashion, but using quadratic
expressions (objects of class
<A HREF="py_quadexpr.html#pythonclass:QuadExpr">QuadExpr</A>) instead.  General
constraints are built using a set of <A HREF="py_model_addgenconstrxxx.html#pythonmethod:Model.addGenConstrXxx">dedicated
  methods</A>, or a set of
<A HREF="py_general_constraint_help.html#pythonclass:GCHelper">general constraint helper
  functions</A> plus overloaded operators.

<P>
Models are dynamic entities; you can always add or remove variables or
constraints.

<P>
We often refer to the <EM>class</EM> of an optimization model.  A
model with a linear objective function, linear constraints, and
continuous variables is a <EM>Linear Program (LP)</EM>.  If the
objective is quadratic, the model is a <EM>Quadratic Program
(QP)</EM>.  If any of the constraints are quadratic, the model is a
<EM>Quadratically-Constrained Program (QCP)</EM>.  We'll sometimes
also discuss a special case of QCP, the <EM>Second-Order Cone
Program (SOCP)</EM>.  If the model contains any integer variables,
semi-continuous variables, semi-integer variables, Special Ordered Set
(SOS) constraints, or general constraints, the model is a
<EM>Mixed Integer Program (MIP)</EM>.  We'll also sometimes discuss
special cases of MIP, including <EM>Mixed Integer Linear Programs
(MILP)</EM>, <EM>Mixed Integer Quadratic Programs (MIQP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programs (MIQCP)</EM>, and
<EM>Mixed Integer Second-Order Cone Programs (MISOCP)</EM>.  The
Gurobi Optimizer handles all of these model classes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Environments</SPAN>

<P>
Environments play a much smaller role in the Gurobi Python interface
than they do in our other language APIs, mainly because the Python
interface has a default environment.  Unless you explicitly pass your
own environment to routines that require an environment, the default
environment will be used.

<P>
The main situation where you may want to create your own environment
is when you want precise control over when the resources associated
with an environment (specifically, a licensing token or a Compute
Server) are released.  If you use your own environment to create
models (using <A HREF="py_read.html#pythonmethod:read">read</A> or the
<A HREF="py_model.html#pythonclass:Model">Model</A> constructor), then the
resources associated with the environment will be released as soon
your program no longer references your environment or any models
created with that environment.

<P>
Note that you can manually remove the reference to the default
environment, thus making it available for garbage collection, by
calling
<A HREF="py_disposedefaultenv.html#pythonmethod:disposeDefaultEnv">disposeDefaultEnv</A>.
After calling this, and after all models built within the default
environment are garbage collected, the default environment will be
garbage collected as well.  A new default environment will be
created automatically if you call a routine that needs one.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Solving a Model</SPAN>

<P>
Once you have built a model, you can call
<A HREF="py_model_optimize.html#pythonmethod:Model.optimize">Model.optimize</A> to
compute a solution.  By default,
<A HREF="py_model_optimize.html#pythonmethod:Model.optimize">optimize</A>
will use the
<A HREF="concurrent_optimizer.html#sec:Concurrent">concurrent optimizer</A>
to solve LP models,
the barrier algorithm to solve QP and QCP models, and
the branch-and-cut algorithm to solve mixed integer models.  The
solution is stored in a set of <EM>attributes</EM> of the model, which
can be subsequently queried (we will return to this topic shortly).

<P>
The Gurobi algorithms keep careful track of the state of the model, so
calls to
<A HREF="py_model_optimize.html#pythonmethod:Model.optimize">Model.optimize</A>
will only perform further optimization if relevant data has changed
since the model was last optimized.  If you would like to discard
previously computed solution information and restart the optimization
from scratch without changing the model, you can call
<A HREF="py_model_reset.html#pythonmethod:Model.reset">Model.reset</A>.

<P>
After a MIP model has been solved, you can call
<A HREF="py_model_fixed.html#pythonmethod:Model.fixed">Model.fixed</A> to
compute the associated <EM>fixed</EM> model.  This model is identical
to the input model, except that all integer variables are fixed to
their values in the MIP solution.  In some applications, it is useful
to compute information on this continuous version of the MIP model
(e.g., dual variables, sensitivity information, etc.).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Multiple Solutions and Multiple Objectives</SPAN>

<P>
By default, the Gurobi Optimizer assumes that your goal is to find one
proven optimal solution to a model with a single objective function.
Gurobi provides features that allow you to relax either of these
assumptions.  You should refer to the section on <A HREF="solution_pool.html#sec:SolutionPool">Solution
  Pools</A> for information on how to request more
than one solution, or the section on <A HREF="multiple_objectives.html#sec:MultipleObjectives">Multiple
  Objectives</A> for information on how to
specify multiple objective functions and control the trade-off between
them.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Infeasible Models</SPAN>

<P>
You have a few options if a model is found to be infeasible.  You can
try to diagnose the cause of the infeasibility, attempt to repair the
infeasibility, or both.  To obtain information that can be useful for
diagnosing the cause of an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="py_model_computeiis.html#pythonmethod:Model.computeIIS">Model.computeIIS</A>
to compute an
Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS).  This method can be used
for both continuous and MIP models, but you should be aware that the
MIP version can be quite expensive.  This method populates a set of
IIS attributes.

<P>
To attempt to repair an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="py_model_feasrelaxs.html#pythonmethod:Model.feasRelaxS">Model.feasRelaxS</A> or
<A HREF="py_model_feasrelax.html#pythonmethod:Model.feasRelax">Model.feasRelax</A>
to compute a
feasibility relaxation for the model.  This relaxation allows you to
find a solution that minimizes the magnitude of the constraint
violation.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying and Modifying Attributes</SPAN>

<P>
Most of the information associated with a Gurobi model is stored in a
set of attributes.  Some attributes are associated with the variables
of the model, some with the constraints of the model, and some with
the model itself.  To give a simple example, solving an optimization
model causes the <code>x</code> variable attribute to be populated.
Attributes such as <code>x</code> that are computed by the Gurobi optimizer
cannot be modified directly by the user, while others, such as the
variable lower bound (the <code>lb</code> attribute) can.

<P>
Attributes can be accessed in two ways in the Python interface.  The
first is to use the <code>getAttr()</code> and <code>setAttr()</code> methods,
which are available on variables
(<A HREF="py_var_getattr.html#pythonmethod:Var.getAttr">Var.getAttr</A>/
<A HREF="py_var_setattr.html#pythonmethod:Var.setAttr">Var.setAttr</A>),
linear constraints
(<A HREF="py_constr_getattr.html#pythonmethod:Constr.getAttr">Constr.getAttr</A>/
<A HREF="py_constr_setattr.html#pythonmethod:Constr.setAttr">Constr.setAttr</A>),
quadratic constraints
(<A HREF="py_qconstr_getattr.html#pythonmethod:QConstr.getAttr">QConstr.getAttr</A>/
<A HREF="py_qconstr_setattr.html#pythonmethod:QConstr.setAttr">QConstr.setAttr</A>),
SOSs (<A HREF="py_sos_getattr.html#pythonmethod:SOS.getAttr">SOS.getAttr</A>),
general constraints
(<A HREF="py_genconstr_getattr.html#pythonmethod:GenConstr.getAttr">GenConstr.getAttr</A>/ 
<A HREF="py_genconstr_setattr.html#pythonmethod:GenConstr.setAttr">GenConstr.setAttr</A>), and
models (<A HREF="py_model_getattr.html#pythonmethod:Model.getAttr">Model.getAttr</A>/
<A HREF="py_model_setattr.html#pythonmethod:Model.setAttr">Model.setAttr</A>).
These are called with the attribute name as the first argument (e.g.,
<code>var.getAttr("x")</code> or <code>constr.setAttr("rhs", 0.0)</code>).  The
full list of available attributes can be found in the
<A HREF="attributes.html#sec:Attributes">Attributes</A> section of this manual.

<P>
Attributes can also be accessed more directly: you can follow an
object name by a period, followed by the name of an attribute of that
object.  Note that upper/lower case is ignored when referring to
attributes.  Thus, <code>b = constr.rhs</code> is equivalent to
<code>b = constr.getAttr("rhs")</code>, and <code>constr.rhs = 0.0</code> is equivalent
to <code>constr.setAttr("rhs", 0.0)</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Additional Model Modification Information</SPAN>

<P>
Most modifications to an existing model are done through the attribute
interface (e.g., changes to variable bounds, constraint right-hand
sides, etc.).  The main exceptions are modifications to the constraint
matrix and to the objective function.

<P>
The constraint matrix can be modified in a few ways.  The first is to
call the
<A HREF="py_model_chgcoeff.html#pythonmethod:Model.chgCoeff">Model.chgCoeff</A> method.
This method can be used to modify the value of an existing non-zero,
to set an existing non-zero to zero, or to create a new non-zero.  The
constraint matrix is also modified when you remove a variable or
constraint from the model (through the
<A HREF="py_model_remove.html#pythonmethod:Model.remove">Model.remove</A> method).
The non-zero values associated with the deleted constraint or
variable are removed along with the constraint or variable itself.

<P>
The model objective function can also be modified in a few ways.  The
easiest is to build an expression that captures the objective function
(a <A HREF="py_linexpr.html#pythonclass:LinExpr">LinExpr</A> or
<A HREF="py_quadexpr.html#pythonclass:QuadExpr">QuadExpr</A> object),
and then pass that expression to method
<A HREF="py_model_setobjective.html#pythonmethod:Model.setObjective">Model.setObjective</A>.
If you wish to modify the objective, you can simply call
<code>setObjective</code> again with a new <code>LinExpr</code> or
<code>QuadExpr</code> object.

<P>
For linear objective functions, an alternative to <code>setObjective</code>
is to use the <code>Obj</code> variable attribute to modify
individual linear objective coefficients.

<P>
If your variables have piecewise-linear objectives, you can specify
them using the <A HREF="py_model_setpwlobj.html#pythonmethod:Model.setPWLObj">Model.setPWLObj</A>
method.  Call this method once for each relevant variable.  The Gurobi
simplex solver includes algorithmic support for convex
piecewise-linear objective functions, so for continuous models you
should see a substantial performance benefit from using this feature.
To clear a previously specified piecewise-linear objective function,
simply set the <code>Obj</code> attribute on the corresponding variable to
0.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lazy Updates</SPAN>

<P>
One important item to note about model modification in the Gurobi
optimizer is that it is performed in a <EM>lazy</EM> fashion, meaning
that modifications don't affect the model immediately.  Rather, they
are queued and applied later.  If your program simply creates a model
and solves it, you will probably never notice this behavior.  However,
if you ask for information about the model before your modifications
have been applied, the details of the lazy update approach may be
relevant to you.

<P>
As we just noted, model modifications (bound changes, right-hand side
changes, objective changes, etc.) are placed in a queue.  These queued
modifications can be applied to the model in three different ways.
The first is by an explicit call to
<A HREF="py_model_update.html#pythonmethod:Model.update">Model.update</A>.  The second is
by a call to <A HREF="py_model_optimize.html#pythonmethod:Model.optimize">Model.optimize</A>.  The
third is by a call to <A HREF="py_model_write.html#pythonmethod:Model.write">Model.write</A> to
write out the model.  The first case gives you fine-grained control
over when modifications are applied.  The second and third make the
assumption that you want all pending modifications to be applied
before you optimize your model or write it to disk.

<P>
Why does the Gurobi interface behave in this manner?  There are a few
reasons.  The first is that this approach makes it much easier to
perform multiple modifications to a model, since the model remains
unchanged between modifications.  The second is that processing model
modifications can be expensive, particularly in a Compute Server
environment, where modifications require communication between
machines.  Thus, it is useful to have visibility into exactly when
these modifications are applied.  In general, if your program needs to
make multiple modifications to the model, you should aim to make them
in phases, where you make a set of modifications, then update, then
make more modifications, then update again, etc.  Updating after each
individual modification can be extremely expensive.

<P>
If you forget to call update, your program won't crash.  Your query
will simply return the value of the requested data from the point of
the last update.  If the object you tried to query didn't exist then,
you'll get a <TT>NOT_IN_MODEL</TT> exception instead.

<P>
The semantics of lazy updates have changed since earlier Gurobi
versions.  While the vast majority of programs are unaffected by this
change, you can use the <A HREF="updatemode.html#parameter:UpdateMode">UpdateMode</A>
parameter to revert to the earlier behavior if you run into an issue.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Managing Parameters</SPAN>

<P>
The Gurobi optimizer provides a set of parameters that allow you to
control many of the details of the optimization process.  Factors like
feasibility and optimality tolerances, choices of algorithms,
strategies for exploring the MIP search tree, etc., can be controlled
by modifying Gurobi parameters before beginning the optimization.
Parameters are set using method
<A HREF="py_model_setparam.html#pythonmethod:Model.setParam">Model.setParam</A>.
Current values may also be retrieved with
<A HREF="py_model_getparaminfo.html#pythonmethod:Model.getParamInfo">Model.getParamInfo</A>.
You can also access parameters more directly through the
<code>Model.Params</code> class.  To set the
<A HREF="mipgap2.html#parameter:MIPGap">MIPGap</A>
 parameter to 0.0 for
model <code>m</code>, for example, you can do either
<code>m.setParam('MIPGap', 0)</code> or
<code>m.Params.MIPGap = 0</code>.

<P>
You can read a set of parameter settings from a file using
<A HREF="py_model_read.html#pythonmethod:Model.read">Model.read</A>,
or write the set of changed parameters using
<A HREF="py_model_write.html#pythonmethod:Model.write">Model.write</A>.

<P>
We also include an automated parameter tuning tool that explores many
different sets of parameter changes in order to find a set that
improves performance.  You can call
<A HREF="py_model_tune.html#pythonmethod:Model.tune">Model.tune</A>
to invoke the tuning tool on a model.
Refer to the
<A HREF="parameter_tuning_tool.html#sec:Tuning">parameter tuning tool</A>
section for more information.

<P>
One thing we should note is that changing a parameter for one model
has no effect on the parameter value for other models.  Use the
global <A HREF="py_setparam.html#pythonmethod:setParam">setParam</A> method to set a
parameter for all loaded models.

<P>
The full list of Gurobi parameters can be found in the
<A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">Parameters</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Monitoring Progress - Logging and Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Progress of the optimization can be monitored through Gurobi logging.
By default, Gurobi will send output to the screen.  A few simple
controls are available for modifying the default logging behavior.
You can set the
<A HREF="logfile.html#parameter:LogFile">LogFile</A>
parameter if you wish to also
direct the Gurobi log to a file.  The frequency of logging output can
be controlled with the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A>
parameter, and logging
can be turned off entirely with the
<A HREF="outputflag.html#parameter:OutputFlag">OutputFlag</A>
parameter.

<P>
Log output is also sent to a Python logger named <code>gurobipy</code>, at
level <code>INFO</code>.  You can use the Python <code>logging</code> module to
connect to this log.

<P>
More detailed progress monitoring can be done through a callback
function.  If you pass a function taking two arguments, <code>model</code>
and <code>where</code>, to
<A HREF="py_model_optimize.html#pythonmethod:Model.optimize">Model.optimize</A>, your function
will be called periodically from within the optimization.  Your
callback can then
call <A HREF="py_model_cbget.html#pythonmethod:Model.cbGet">Model.cbGet</A> to
retrieve additional information on the state of the optimization.  You
can refer to the <A HREF="py_callbacks.html#pythonclass:Callback">Callback</A> class
for additional information.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modifying Solver Behavior - Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Callbacks can also be used to modify the behavior of the Gurobi
optimizer.  The simplest control callback is
<A HREF="py_model_terminate.html#pythonmethod:Model.terminate">Model.terminate</A>,
which asks the optimizer to terminate at the earliest convenient
point.  Method
<A HREF="py_model_cbsetsolution.html#pythonmethod:Model.cbSetSolution">Model.cbSetSolution</A>
allows you to inject a feasible solution (or partial solution) during
the solution of a MIP model.  Methods
<A HREF="py_model_cbcut.html#pythonmethod:Model.cbCut">Model.cbCut</A>
and
<A HREF="py_model_cblazy.html#pythonmethod:Model.cbLazy">Model.cbLazy</A>
allow you to add <EM>cutting planes</EM> and <EM>lazy constraints</EM>
during a MIP optimization, respectively.
Method <A HREF="py_model_cbstoponemultiobj.html#pythonmethod:Model.cbStopOneMultiObj">Model.cbStopOneMultiObj</A> allows you to interrupt the optimization process of one of the optimization steps in
a multi-objective MIP problem without stopping the hierarchical
optimization process.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Error Handling</SPAN>

<P>
All of the methods in the Gurobi Python library can throw an exception
of type <A HREF="py_gurobierror.html#pythonclass:GurobiError">GurobiError</A>.  When an
exception occurs, additional information on the error can be obtained
by retrieving the <code>errno</code> or <code>message</code> members of the
<code>GurobiError</code> object.  A list of possible values for the
<code>errno</code> field can be found in the <A HREF="error_codes.html#sec:ErrorCodes">Error
Code</A> section.
