Subtleties and Limitations</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are a few subtleties associated with finding multiple solutions
that we'll cover now.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Continuous Variables</SPAN>

<P>
One subtlety arises when considering multiple solutions for models
with continuous variables.  Specifically, you may have two solutions
that take identical values on the integer variables but where some
continuous variables differ.  By choosing different points on the line
between these two solutions, you actually have an infinite number of
choices for feasible solutions to the problem.  To avoid this issue,
we define two solutions as being equivalent if they take the same
values on all integer variables (and on all continuous variables that
participate in SOS constraints).  A solution will be discarded if it
is equivalent to another solution that is already in the pool.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Optimality Gap</SPAN>

<P>
The interplay between the optimality gap
(<A HREF="mipgap2.html#parameter:MIPGap">MIPGap</A> or
<A HREF="mipgapabs.html#parameter:MIPGapAbs">MIPGapAbs</A>) and multiple solutions
can be a bit subtle.  When using the default <code>PoolSearchMode</code>, a
non-zero optimality gap indicates that you are willing to allow the
MIP solver to declare a solution optimal, even though the model may
have other, better solutions.  The claim the solver makes upon
termination is that no other solution would improve the incumbent
objective by more than the optimality gap.  Terminating at this point
is ultimately a pragmatic choice - we'd probably rather have the true
best solution, but the cost of reducing the optimality gap to zero can
often be prohibitive.

<P>
This pragmatic choice can produce a bit of confusion when finding
multiple optimal solutions.  Specifically, if you ask for the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> best
solutions, the optimality gap plays a similar role as it does in the
default case, but the implications may be a bit harder to understand.
Specifically, a non-zero optimality gap means that you are willing to
allow the solver to declare that it has found the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> best solutions,
even though there may be solutions that are better than those that
were returned.  The claim in this case is that any solution not among
the reported <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> best would improve on the objective for the worst
among the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> best by less than the optimality gap.

<P>
If you want to avoid this source of potential confusion, you should
set the optimality gap to 0 when using <code>PoolSearchMode=2</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Logging</SPAN>

<P>
If you browse the log from a MIP solve with <code>PoolSearchMode</code> set
to a non-default value, you may see the lower bound on the objective
exceed the upper bound.  This can't happen with the default
<code>PoolSearchMode</code> - if you are only looking for one optimal
solution, the search is done as soon as the lower bound reaches the
upper bound.  However, if you are looking for the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> best solutions,
you have to prove that the model has no solution better than the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN>th
best.  The objective for that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN>th solution could be much worse than
that of the incumbent.
In this situation, the log file will include a line of the form:
<PRE>
Optimal solution found at node 123 - now completing solution pool...
</PRE>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Distributed MIP</SPAN>

<P>
One limitation that we should point out related to multiple solutions
is that the distributed MIP solver has not been extended to support
non-default <code>PoolSearchMode</code> settings.  Distributed MIP will
typically produce many more feasible solutions than non-distributed
MIP, but there's no way to ask it to find the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> best solutions.
