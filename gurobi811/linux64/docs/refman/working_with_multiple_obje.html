Working With Multiple Objective</A>
</H2>

<P>
Of course, specifying a set of objectives is only the first step in
solving a multi-objective optimization problem.  The next step is to
indicate how the objectives should be combined.  As noted earlier, we
support two approaches: blended and hierarchical.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Blended Objectives</SPAN></BIG>
<A NAME="heading:BlendedObjectives"></A>
<P>
A blending approach creates a single objective by taking a linear
combination of your objectives.  You provide a weight for each
objective as an argument to <code>setObjectiveN</code>.  Alternatively, you
can use the <A HREF="objnweight.html#attr:ObjNWeight">ObjNWeight</A> attribute,
together with <A HREF="objnumber.html#parameter:ObjNumber">ObjNumber</A>.  The
default weight for an objective is 1.0.

<P>
To give an example, if your model has two objectives, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img150.png"
 ALT="$1 + x + 2y$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img151.png"
 ALT="$y
+ 2z$"></SPAN>, and if you give weights of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img152.png"
 ALT="$-1$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img87.png"
 ALT="$2$"></SPAN> to them, respectively,
then Gurobi would solve your model with a blended objective of
<!-- MATH
 $-1 \cdot (1 + x + 2y) + 2 \cdot (y + 2z) = -1 - x + 4z$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="321" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img153.png"
 ALT="$-1 \cdot (1 + x + 2y) + 2 \cdot (y + 2z) = -1 - x + 4z$"></SPAN>.

<P>
You should avoid weights that are very large or very small.  A very
large weight (i.e., larger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img154.png"
 ALT="$10^6$"></SPAN>) may lead to very large
objective coefficients, which can cause numerical difficulties.  A
very small weight (i.e., smaller than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img109.png"
 ALT="$1e-6$"></SPAN>) may cause the
contribution from that objective to the overall blended objective to
be smaller than tolerances, which may lead to that objective being
effectively ignored.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hierarchical Objectives</SPAN></BIG>

<P>
A hierarchical or lexicographic approach assigns a priority to each
objective, and optimizes for the objectives in decreasing priority
order.  At each step, it finds the best solution for the current
objective, but only from among those that would not degrade the
solution quality for higher-priority objectives.  You provide the
priority for each objective as an argument to <code>setObjectiveN</code>.
Alternatively, you can use the
<A HREF="objnpriority.html#attr:ObjNPriority">ObjNPriority</A> attribute.  Priorities
are integral, not continuous.  Larger values indicate higher
priorities.  The default priority for an objective is 0.

<P>
To give an example, if your model has two objectives, with priorities
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img155.png"
 ALT="$10$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img156.png"
 ALT="$5$"></SPAN>, and the optimal solution for the first objective has
value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img157.png"
 ALT="$100$"></SPAN>, then the solver will find the solution that optimizes the
second objective from among all solutions with objective <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img157.png"
 ALT="$100$"></SPAN> for the
first objective.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Allowing Multiple-Objective Degradation</SPAN></BIG>

<P>
By default, our hierarchical approach won't allow later objectives to
degrade earlier objectives.  This behavior can be relaxed for MIPs through a
pair of tolerances: a relative and an absolute tolerance.  These are
provided as arguments to <code>setObjectiveN</code>, or they can be set
using attributes <A HREF="objnreltol.html#attr:ObjNRelTol">ObjNRelTol</A> and
<A HREF="objnabstol.html#attr:ObjNAbsTol">ObjNAbsTol</A>.  By setting one of these
for a particular objective, you can indicate that later objectives are
allowed to degrade this objective by the specified relative or
absolute amount, respectively.  In our earlier example, if the optimal
value for the first objective is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img157.png"
 ALT="$100$"></SPAN>, and if we set
<code>ObjNAbsTol</code> for this objective to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img158.png"
 ALT="$20$"></SPAN>, then the second
optimization step would find the best solution for the second
objective from among all solutions with objective <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img159.png"
 ALT="$120$"></SPAN> or better for
the first objective.  Note that if you modify both tolerances, later
optimizations would use the looser of the two values (i.e., the one
that allows the larger degradation).

<P>
Objective degradations are handled differently for multi-objective LP
models.  For LP models, solution quality for higher-priority objectives is
maintained by fixing some variables to their values in previous
optimal solutions.  These fixings are decided using variable reduced
costs.  The value of the <code>ObjNAbsTol</code> parameter indicates the
amount by which a fixed variable's reduced cost is allowed to violate
dual feasibility, whereas the <code>ObjNRelTol</code> parameter is simply
ignored.
If you want the MIP behavior, where the degradation is controlled
more directly, you can add a dummy binary variable to the model, thus
transforming it into a MIP.  Solving the resulting multi-objective MIP
will be much more time consuming than solving the original multi-objective LP.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Combining Blended and Hierarchical Objectives</SPAN></BIG>

<P>
You can actually set both a weight and a priority for each objective.
This allows you to combine the blended and hierarchical approaches.
To understand how this works, we should first provide more detail on
how hierarchical objectives are handled.

<P>
When you specify a different priority for each of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> objectives, the
solver performs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> separate optimization steps.  In each step, in
decreasing priority order, it optimizes for the current objective,
while imposing constraints that ensure that the quality of
higher-priority objectives isn't degraded by more than the specified
tolerances.

<P>
If you give the same priority to multiple objectives, then they will
be handled in the same optimization step, resulting in fewer than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN>
total steps for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> objectives.  More precisely, one optimization step
is performed per distinct priority value, in order of decreasing
priority, and all objectives with the same priority are blended
together, using the weights for those objectives.  This gives you
quite a bit of flexibility when combining the blended and hierarchical
approaches.

<P>
One subtle point when blending multiple objectives within a single
level in a hierarchical approach relates to the handling of
degradations from lower-priority levels.  The objective degradation
allowed after a blended optimization step is the maximum absolute and
relative degradations allowed by each of the participating
objectives. For example, if we have three objectives with
<code>ObjNPriority</code> equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img160.png"
 ALT="$\{2, 2, 1\}$"></SPAN>, and <code>ObjNRelTol</code>
equal to <!-- MATH
 $\{0.10, 0.05, 0.00\}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img161.png"
 ALT="$\{0.10, 0.05, 0.00\}$"></SPAN> and <code>ObjNAbsTol</code> equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img162.png"
 ALT="$\{0,
1, 2\}$"></SPAN>, and if the best solution for the first priority objective is
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img155.png"
 ALT="$10$"></SPAN>, then the allowed degradation for the first priority objective is
<!-- MATH
 $\max\{10 \cdot 0.10, 10 \cdot 0.05, 0, 1\}~=~1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img163.png"
 ALT="$\max\{10 \cdot 0.10, 10 \cdot 0.05, 0, 1\}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1$"></SPAN>.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying multi-objective results</SPAN></BIG>

<P>
Multiple objective values can be queried programmatically in all our APIs.
The basic notion is that you have to specify for which multi objective
you want to query information (by setting the parameter
<A HREF="objnumber.html#parameter:ObjNumber">ObjNumber</A>).
Furthermore, you can also specify for which solution you want to query
this information (by setting the parameter
<A HREF="solutionnumber.html#parameter:SolutionNumber">SolutionNumber</A>).
For example, in Python you can do the following:
<SCRIPT SRC="https://cdn.rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/loader/run_prettify.js"></SCRIPT>
<BR>
<PRE CLASS="prettyprint"># Read and solve a model with multiple objectives
m = read('input.mps')
m.optimize()

# get the set of variables
x = m.getVars()

# Ensure status is optimal
assert m.Status == GRB.Status.OPTIMAL

# Query number of multiple objectives, and number of solutions
nSolutions  = m.SolCount
nObjectives = m.NumObj
print('Problem has', nObjectives, 'objectives')
print('Gurobi found', nSolutions, 'solutions')

# For each solution, print value of first three variables, and
# value for each objective function
solutions = []
for s in range(nSolutions):
  # Set which solution we will query from now on
  m.params.SolutionNumber = s

  # Print objective value of this solution in each objective
  print('Solution', s, ':', end='')
  for o in range(nObjectives):
    # Set which objective we will query
    m.params.ObjNumber = o
    # Query the o-th objective value
    print(' ',m.ObjNVal, end='')

  # print first three variables in the solution
  n = min(len(x),3)
  for j in range(n):
    print(x[j].VarName, x[j].Xn, end='')
  print('')

  # query the full vector of the o-th solution
  solutions.append(m.getAttr('Xn',x))
</PRE>
