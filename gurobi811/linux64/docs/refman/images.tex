\providecommand{\EnvargPool}{%
The machine pool.  Machine pools allow you to create fixed
configurations on the Instant Cloud website (capturing things
like type of machine, geographic region, etc.), and then launch
and share machines from client programs without having to
restarte the configuration information each time you launch a
machine.  May be \texttt{NULL} (or an empty string), in which case
your job will be launched in the default pool associated with
your cloud license.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargSecretKey}{%
The secret key for your Gurobi Instant Cloud license.  This can
be retrieved from the Gurobi Instant Cloud website.  When used in
combination with your \texttt{accessID}, this allows you to launch
Instant Cloud instances and submit jobs to them.  Note that you
should keep your secret key private.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargAccessID}{%
The access ID for your Gurobi Instant Cloud license.  This can be
retrieved from the Gurobi Instant Cloud website.  When used in
combination with your \texttt{secretKey}, this allows you to launch
Instant Cloud instances and submit jobs to them.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargTlsInsecure}{%
Indicates whether to use insecure mode in the TLS (Transport
Layer Security).  Set this to 0 unless your server administrator
tells you otherwise.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargGroup}{The name of the Compute Server group.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargPassword}{%
The password for gaining access to the specified Compute Server
cluster.  Pass an empty string if no password is required.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargComputeServer}{%
A Compute Server.  You can refer to the server using its name or
its IP address.  If you are using a non-default port, the server
name should be followed by the port number (e.g.,
\texttt{server1:61000})} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargTimeout}{%
Queue timeout (in seconds).  If the job doesn't reach the front of
the queue before the specified timeout, the call will exit with a
\texttt{JOB\_REJECTED} error.  Use -1 to indicate
that the call should never timeout.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargRouter}{%
The router for a Compute Server cluster.  A router can be used to
improve the robustness of a Compute Server deployment.  You
should refer to the router using either its name or its IP
address.  If no router is used (which is the typical case), pass
an empty string.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargPriorityCloud}{%
The priority of the job.  Priorities must be between -100 and
100, with a default value of 0 (by convention).  Higher priority
jobs are chosen from the server job queue before lower priority
jobs.} 

%
\providecommand{\EnvargPriorityCS}{%
The priority of the job.  Priorities must be between -100 and
100, with a default value of 0 (by convention).  Higher priority
jobs are chosen from the server job queue before lower priority
jobs.\ Depending on the configuration of the
server, a job with priority 100 runs immediately, bypassing the
job queue and ignoring the job limit on the server. You should
exercise caution with priority 100 jobs, since they can severely
overload a server, which can cause jobs to fail, and in extreme
cases can cause the server to crash.  This behavior is managed by
the {\ttfamily HARDJOBLIMIT}, and is dissabled by default. Refer
to the \htmladdnormallink{Gurobi Remote Services Reference
Manual}{../remoteservices/remoteservices.html} for more
information on starting Compute Server options.} 

%
\providecommand{\envreadprm}[1]{%
This #1 will also check the current working directory for a file

\providecommand{\envrecommendeduse}{%
In general, you should aim to create a single Gurobi environment

%
\providecommand{\CbStopMultiobjUsage}{%
You would typically stop a multi-objective optimization step
by quering the last finished number of multi-objectives steps,
and using that number to stop the current step and move
on to the next hierarchical objective (if any) as shown in the
following example:} 

%
\providecommand{\CbStopMultiobjMOS}{%
You should refer to the section on \hyperref{Multiple

them.} 

%
\providecommand{\CbStopMultiobjObjnumArg}{%
\hspace{20 mm}{\textbf{objnum}}: The number of the multi-objective optimization step

\providecommand{\EmptyEnvDesc}[1]{%
You should use #1 if you want to set parameters before actually
starting the environment.  This can be useful if you want to
connect to a Compute Server, a token server, or the Gurobi
Instant Cloud.  See the \hyperref{Empty

%
\providecommand{\GrbMaxintNote}{%
One important note about integer-valued parameters: while the maximum
value that can be stored in a signed integer is $2^{31}-1$, we use a
{\ttfamily MAXINT} value of 2,000,000,000.  Attempting to set an integer
parameter to a value larger than this maximum will produce an error.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBwarmstartwarning}{%
Note that if you provide a valid starting extreme point, either through
{\ttfamily \hyperref{PStart}{}{}{attr:PStart},
\hyperref{DStart}{}{}{attr:DStart}}, or through {\ttfamily
\hyperref{VBasis}{}{}{attr:VBasis}, \hyperref{CBasis}{}{}{attr:CBasis}},
then LP presolve will be disabled.} 

%
\providecommand{\Farkasdesc}{%
Together, attributes \hyperref{FarkasDual}{}{}{attr:FarkasDual} and
\hyperref{FarkasProof}{}{}{attr:FarkasProof} provide a certificate of
infeasibility for the given problem.  Specifically, they can
be used to form the following inequality from the original
constraints that is trivially infeasible:


\begin{displaymath} \bar{a}x = \lambda^tAx \leq \lambda^tb = -\beta + \sum\limits_{j:\bar{a}_j<0}\bar{a}_jU_j + \sum\limits_{j:\bar{a}_j>0}\bar{a}_jL_j,\end{displaymath}


where $\beta>0$, $L_j$\  is the lower bound of variable $x_j$, $U_j$\  is the upper
bound of variable $x_j$, $\lambda_i \geq 0$\  if the $i$-th constraint
has a $\leq$\  sense, $\lambda_i \leq 0$\  if the $i$-th constraint has a
$\geq$\  sense, $\bar{a}_j \geq 0$\  if $U_j =  \infty$, and $\bar{a}_j
\leq 0$\  if $L_j = -\infty$.
This constraint can not be satisfied for any $\beta>0$.
The FarkasProof attribute provides $\beta$, and the FarkasDual attributes
provide $\lambda$\  multipliers for the original constraints.


This attribute is only available when parameter
\hyperref{InfUnbdInfo}{}{}{parameter:InfUnbdInfo} is set to 1.

%
\providecommand{\pythonname}{%
Note that \texttt{name} will be stored as an ASCII string. Thus, a name
like {\ttfamily 'A${\rightarrow}$B'} will produce an error, because
'${\rightarrow}$' can not be represented as an ASCII character. Note
also that names that contain spaces are strongly discouraged,
because they can't be written to LP format files.} 

%
\providecommand{\pythonnames}{%
The given name will be subscripted by the index of the generator
expression, so if the index is an integer, \texttt{c} would become
\texttt{c[0]}, \texttt{c[1]}, etc.
Note that the generated names will be stored as ASCII strings, so you
should avoid using names that contain non-ASCII characters. In
addition, names that contain spaces are strongly discouraged, because
they can't be written to LP format files.} 

%
\providecommand{\getmultiobjenvdesc}{%
Create/retrieve a multi-objective
environment for the objective with the given index. This
environment enables fine-grained control over the multi-objective
optimization process. Specifically, by changing parameters on this
environment, you modify the behavior of the optimization that
occurs during the corresponding pass of the multi-objective
optimization.


Each multi-objective environment starts with a copy of the current
model environment.


Please refer to the discussion of
\hyperref{Multiple Objectives}{}{}{sec:MultipleObjectives} for
information on how to specify multiple objective functions and control
the trade-off between them.} 

%
\providecommand{\discardmultiobjenvsdesc}{%
Discard all multi-objective environments associated with the model,
thus restoring multi objective optimization to its default behavior.

\texttt{.mst} for writing a start vector, \texttt{.hnt} for writing a hint

utilities (e.g., {\ttfamily 7z} or {\ttfamily zip} for Windows, and
{\ttfamily gzip}, {\ttfamily bzip2}, or {\ttfamily unzip} for Linux or
Mac OS); then the files can be compressed, so additional suffixes of

\providecommand{\quadterminfo}[1]{%
  A quadratic term is represented using three values: a pair of indices
  (stored in \texttt{qrow} and \texttt{qcol}), and a coefficient (stored in
  \texttt{qval}). The three argument arrays provide the corresponding values
  for each quadratic term. To give an example, to represent
  $2 x_0^2 + x_0 x_1 + x_1^2$, you would have \texttt{#1=3},
  \texttt{qrow[] = \{0, 0, 1\}}, \texttt{qcol[] = \{0, 1, 1\}}, and
  \texttt{qval[] = \{2.0, 1.0, 1.0\}}}%
